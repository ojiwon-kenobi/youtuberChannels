Its all a good time. \\n\\nSpoilers*** for post video watchers:\\nJust so we are 100000% clear, a 10 to me, includes a lot more than just looks, but ambition, personality, humor, dedication ect ect.

       "   'description': \"oof owie ouchie\\n\\nThis video is about a time I got hurt. I don't know how much of the video I should explain without spoiling it. Then again who reads the youtube description before watching the video? If you are that person: hello. You are using youtube wrong. You will be dealt with accordingly.\\n\\nThis video took too long. I could have been done with it months ago but I kept second guessing myself and rerecording the audio and reformatting and blah blah blah. It was a terrible work flow and I think for future videos I need to just embrace imperfection and commit to what I have (if I don't want to take literally half a year to post something). The problem is that embracing imperfection is HARD. I said I would do the same thing in the last video and look where that got us.\\n\\nAnyway I have a flight to catch literally today so I'm glad I crunched this out and got it posted. I hope you are also glad, and I also hope you enjoy the video.\\n\\n\\nbye ✨🤠✨\\n\\nvideo dingo made with me in it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8XqaH53C3s\\n\\nLinks: Twitter - https://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuy\\nComics - http://www.icecreamsandwichcomics.com/\\n\\n\\nDISCLAIMER: Ice Cream Sandwich content is inappropriate for children under 13 years old.

Awesome, cause us swag epic bedheads are so close to hitting 500k! Isn’t that insane? I feel I hardly post enough to earn so many supporters and yet here you all are, patiently waiting and continuing to show me love. I appreciate it a whole bunch….wish I could express this on a video that WASN’T about weewee, but that’s fine. It’s on brand. \\nHope you all enjoyed the video, I think it’s funny. Makes me laugh remembering it, but I believe that’s enough embarrassing nostalgia for me.

Then again who reads the youtube description before watching the video? If you are that person: hello. You are using youtube wrong. You will be dealt with accordingly.\\n\\nThis video took too long. I could have been done with it months ago but I kept second guessing myself and rerecording the audio and reformatting and blah blah blah. It was a terrible work flow and I think for future videos I need to just embrace imperfection and commit to what I have (if I don't want to take literally half a year to post something). The problem is that embracing imperfection is HARD. I said I would do the same thing in the last video and look where that got us.\\n\\nAnyway I have a flight to catch literally today so I'm glad I crunched this out and got it posted. I hope you are also glad, and I also hope you enjoy the video.\\n\\n\\nbye ✨🤠✨\\n\\nvideo dingo made with me in it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8XqaH53C3s\\n\\nLinks: Twitter - https://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuy\\nComics - http://www.icecreamsandwichcomics.com/\\n\\n\\nDISCLAIMER: Ice Cream Sandwich content is inappropriate for children under 13 years old.
