    "Simply put, R is the correlation between the predicted values and the observed values of Y. R square is the square of this coefficient and indicates the percentage of variation explained by your regression line out of the total variation. This value tends to increase as you include additional predictors in the model. Thus, one can artificially get higher  R square by increasing the number of Xs in the model. To penalize this effect, adjusted R square is used. When you compare models with their complexity, you should then rely on Adj R square. Predicted R square is another measure which addresses the issue of overfitting the data  and explain the prediction power for future observations. "

    "A crucial step in null hypothesis testing is finding the likelihood of the sample result if the null hypothesis were true. This probability is called the p value. A low p value means that the sample result would be unlikely if the null hypothesis were true and leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis. A high p value means that the sample result would be likely if the null hypothesis were true and leads to the retention of the null hypothesis. But how low must the p value be before the sample result is considered unlikely enough to reject the null hypothesis? In null hypothesis testing, this criterion is called α (alpha) and is almost always set to .05. If there is less than a 5% chance of a result as extreme as the sample result if the null hypothesis were true, then the null hypothesis is rejected. When this happens, the result is said to be statistically significant. If there is greater than a 5% chance of a result as extreme as the sample result when the null hypothesis is true, then the null hypothesis is retained. This does not necessarily mean that the researcher accepts the null hypothesis as true—only that there is not currently enough evidence to conclude that it is true. Researchers often use the expression “fail to reject the null hypothesis” rather than “retain the null hypothesis,” but they never use the expression “accept the null hypothesis.”\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Misunderstood p Value\n",
    "\n",
    "> The p value is one of the most misunderstood quantities in psychological research (Cohen, 1994)[1]. Even professional researchers misinterpret it, and it is not unusual for such misinterpretations to appear in statistics textbooks!\n",
    "\n",
    "> The most common misinterpretation is that the p value is the probability that the null hypothesis is true—that the sample result occurred by chance. For example, a misguided researcher might say that because the p value is .02, there is only a 2% chance that the result is due to chance and a 98% chance that it reflects a real relationship in the population. But this is incorrect. The p value is really the probability of a result at least as extreme as the sample result if the null hypothesis were true. So a p value of .02 means that if the null hypothesis were true, a sample result this extreme would occur only 2% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can avoid this misunderstanding by remembering that the p value is not the probability that any particular hypothesis is true or false. Instead, it is the probability of obtaining the sample result if the null hypothesis were true."
