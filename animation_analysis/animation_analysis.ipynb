       "  'description': \"This week, we talk about one of the things I get judged for a LOT. Not wanting a hot girlfriend / wife. Yup, a 10, a dime piece, whatever you want to call it. And I explain this all in the form of a story where  me and some friends almost get kicked out of a waffle house. Its all a good time. \\n\\nSpoilers*** for post video watchers:\\nJust so we are 100000% clear, a 10 to me, includes a lot more than just looks, but ambition, personality, humor, dedication ect ect. It's really subjective to everyone, but THATS what I consider! Therefore when I talk about improving myself, I mean improving those too, so I can up my own personal status. Cool? Cool. \\n\\n-----\\nStay up to date when videos are coming out!

Then again who reads the youtube description before watching the video? If you are that person: hello. You are using youtube wrong. You will be dealt with accordingly.\\n\\nThis video took too long. I could have been done with it months ago but I kept second guessing myself and rerecording the audio and reformatting and blah blah blah. It was a terrible work flow and I think for future videos I need to just embrace imperfection and commit to what I have (if I don't want to take literally half a year to post something). The problem is that embracing imperfection is HARD. I said I would do the same thing in the last video and look where that got us.\\n\\nAnyway I have a flight to catch literally today so I'm glad I crunched this out and got it posted.

I was just the first one to speak so please give everyone a chance to talk before assuming anything about them. I spoke with a lot of emotion and described what I saw. Daniel isn't me so please let him give his side before assuming my side is an absolute truth.\\n\\n\\nThis isn't my typical video. I would much rather have fun streaming today, but things have changed, for better or for worse.\\n\\n\\nThank you to all the people who cared to watch me on DanPlan throughout these past five years. I'm sorry for leaving DanPlan barely a week into 2020, but I needed to give you all an update. And I'm really sorry Hosuh, for leaving you alone on the channel. I kept telling myself to keep going, hoping that I'd be able to see the end of this journey with you. But I couldn't. And I can't. I'm sorry for being selfish and dragging you into my fight nine months ago. I truly do wish you the best on the channel. \\n\\n\\nDanPlan has changed so much since we started years ago, so much so that I don't even know what I'm watching anymore, even though I'm the one speaking. I know that what I have said, done, and will be saying in the video can't be taken back. But I need to say it. And any future DanPlan members need to hear this before getting involved with the channel. Don't let the fame get to your head like it did mine.\\n\\n\\nI'm planning to do another Q&A stream next week at my usual time on Saturday but nothing before then. I've asked Blank to gather up some questions you all might have so please message her if you want more answers next week. I know it's cowardly to drop this on everyone and run away for a week, but I need some time off of YouTube after wrecking a friendship I've had since middle school. \\n\\n\\nI wish every one of my fans the best in the new year. Thanks for a great five years, and cheers to the next hundred.\"},\n",

Thanks bud!\\n\\nHOLY HECK I have been gone for so long. As most of y'all know, I suffered a traumatic brain injury and developed post concussion syndrome. My entire life for the past four months has been pain and hospital visits. I'm still not healed and most likely will have to live with it for the rest of my life, but I can animate again! I'll try to get back to uploading frequently, I missed y'all :-)\\n\\nI animate in Toon Boom and edit in Premiere Pro and use a Huion GT 221 to draw!\"},\n",
